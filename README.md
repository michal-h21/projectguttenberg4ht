The aim of this project is to create package for Project Guttenberg TeX files.
Currently, these files contain dozens of custom commands in the preamble, which
isn't really good style.

It was inspired by [this question on
reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/LaTeX/comments/40sgbq/can_someone_convert_this_tiny_tex_to_html_for_me/),
because I've found that the TeX file can't compile because of many errors which
showed whne the document was compiled with tex4ht.
